# Adaptation


The goal of these experiments is to assess the effect on the LFP response to a stimulus when that stimulus is immediately preceded by an identical or similar stimulus.

## Multiple-Repetitions Adaptation

Two stimulus categories: 20 selective stimuli (represented below by letters other than X) and 20 nonselective stimuli (represented by letter X)   
Randomly inserted in each de-adapting block is the stop-sign stimulus. The patient's task is to press a button every time the stop-sign appears.   
**Design:**   
1) X X X X X X X X - de-adapting block   
2) A A A A A A A A - Multiple-repetition adaptation   
3) X X X X X X X X - de-adapting block   
4) B C D E F G H I- Cross adaptation (8 different selective stimuli displayed in a row)  
Repeat 20 times. Stimuli are randomized for each block.
  
   
**Notes:**   
--Stimuli are shown at 2 Hz for 125 ms.   
-- We expect the LFP to adapt most from the first to the second presentation.   
Optional variants:   
A B A B A B A B - Alternating Adaptation (2 different selective stimuli alternated back and forth)  
A X A X A X A X - Time course of adaptation (Repetitions of a selective stimulus interleaved with nonselective (de-adapting) stimuli.   
By varying the number of interleaved nonselective stimuli, we can assess how long it takes for the adaptive effect to disappear.

## Identical-Stimulus

**Stimuli:** Two sets  
1) adapting stimulus (A) – a high-response stimulus which we expect to demonstrate LFP adaptation  
2) Intervening stimuli (X)– 15 unresponsive stimuli which de-adapt neurons  
  
**Design:** Six-block modules  
1) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
2) A A X X X X X– a direct repeat of A, and 5 intervening stimuli  
3) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
4) A X X X X – Single-presentation of A serves as a control condition  
5) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
6) A X X X X X A - A, five intervening stimuli, and another A   
  
**Miscellani**  
• 2 Hz stimulus presentation time – 500 ms ISI  
• One run = 30 modules = 180 blocks  
• 1 block = ~10 second; 1 run = 18 minutes  
• One of the X stimuli is a stop-sign, and the patient is told to press a button every time a stop-sign appears

## Within-Category

**Stimuli:** Two sets  
1) adapting stimuli (A and B) – Two high-response stimulus in the selective category  
2) Intervening stimuli (X)– 15 unresponsive stimuli which de-adapt neurons  
  
**Design:** Twelve-block modules  
1) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
2) A B X X X X X– A -> B, Quantifies adaptation effect of A on B  
3) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
4) A X X X X X – Single-presentation of A serves as a control condition  
5) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
6) A X X X X X B - Quantifies adaptation effect of A on B with 5 intervening trials  
7) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
8) B A X X X X X– B -> A, Quantifies adaptation effect of B on A  
9) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
10) B X X X X X – Single-presentation of B serves as a control condition  
11) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
12) B X X X X X A - Quantifies adaptation effect of B on A with 5 intervening trials

**Miscellani**  
• 1.3 Hz stimulus presentation time – 750 ms ISI  
• One run = 30 modules = 360 blocks  
• 1 block = ~10 seconds; 1 module = 2 minutes; 1 run = 60 minutes

## Cross-modality

Display near-identical stimuli next to each other and calculate adaptation. Hypothesis: Adaptation willl occur if the stimulus feature which this area of cortex is encoding is the same for both stimuli.   
Vary stimulus A along different axes: for example, A' is a negative of A   
**Stimuli:** Two sets  
1) adapting stimuli (A and A') – High-response stimulus and a somehow similar stimulus  
2) Intervening stimuli (X) – 15 unresponsive stimuli which de-adapt neurons  
  
**Design:** Four-block modules  
1) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
2) A A' X X X X X– A adjacent to A'. Quantifies adaptation effect of A' on A  
3) X X X X X X X – De-adaptation block  
4) A X X X X X X – Single-presentation of A serves as a control condition  
5) A' A X X X X X - A' adjacent to A. Quantifies adaptation effect of A' on A
