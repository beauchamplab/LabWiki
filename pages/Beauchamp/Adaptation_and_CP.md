# Adaptation and CP


## Adaptation and Choice Probability

A variant of the one-back object-selectivity task, this experiment attempts to correlate LFP strength and percent-adaptation with the subject's behavioral response.

**Repeat Adaptation Task:**   
Series of grayscale images are shown, and the patient is told to press a button every time he/she sees an image repeated.
For each trial, 8-12 images are shown at random, then a random image is repeated, and the subject has 2 seconds to press the button. Rinse and repeat. We'd like to get at least 70 trials at ~70% accuracy. This way, we'll have at least 49 LFPs for the hit condition and 21 for the miss condition.  
***Note:*** We may need to make the task more difficult to get a 70% hit probability. One way to do this would be to randomize the position of the stimulus. Another would be to decrease the contrast of the stimuli.  
  
**Cross Adaptation Task:**   
Series of selective and nonselective images are shown, and the patient is told to press a button every time he/she sees two selective stimuli in a row ( e.g. "two faces in a row").
For each trial, 8-12 images are shown at random, in which no selective stimuli are shown back to back. Then two selective stimuli are shown in a row, and the subject has 2 seconds to press the button. As above, we'd like to get enough trials to assess choice probability.
