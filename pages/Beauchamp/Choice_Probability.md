# Choice Probability


## Stimulus-Overlay Choice Probability

Choose two stimuli which elicit responses to two different electrodes, and overlay them at different contrasts across an array of stimuli. Show these images to the patient and have gim press button 1 or 2 depending on which image he thinks is more visible. We'll then correlate the srength of the LFP with the likelihood that he chooses the preferred stimulus.
