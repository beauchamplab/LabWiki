## RAVE Clinical Workflow

1. On day of implantation, fellow/clinical team/Chris requests preop volumetric MRI and post-implant CT scan
2. Upload the images to Box Phase 2 implant data (fellow vs Chris). Create a folder with date of implant MM/DD/YY with subfolders for CT and MRI.
3. Create a excel spreadsheet with list of all electrodes under electrode column. Over course of admission, update the other columns (Interictals, Ictal onset, Ictal early spread)
4. Work with Buffy to label electrodes correctly (Tuesday?)
