#### MS4 Neuroimaging Elective: BSCI 4008

[Web page for fourth-year neuroimaging elective](NeuroimagingElective.md "Beauchamp:NeuroimagingElective")

In the 2nd week of the month before the elective, create the course web page in blackboard.
Just copy the page to a new page and rename it. Must manually set up all of the sub-pages (check with BB admin, may be a better way to do this).
Send out an e-mail to all enrolled students telling them about the web-page and give the date and time for the first meeting of the elective.
This would typically be on the first Tuesday of the month in the morning.

If necessary, divide the students into groups BEFORE the first meeting. At the first meeting, all of the students in a group meet to create the schedule for the month. This can be difficult during interview months. The general format is
Week 2A (e.g. Tues): present topic for elective (20 min)
Week 2B (e.g. Thurs): present Journal Club 1 (20 minutes)
Week 3: present Journal Club 2
Week 4: Final Presentation, turn in poster

At the first meeting, give an overview of the course to make sure expectations are clear.

This is essentially independent study, so you will get out of it what you put into it. However, because humans are weak, and 4th years are susceptible to senioritis some structure is required. Document all work in the wiki.
Must present a substantial, high-quality research paper not a meta-analysis or clinical review. Read the whole paper thoughtfully, not just the abstract. Do it far enough in advance that if you realize the paper is bad you can pick another one. Must submit and use a PPT, just as you will as a resident. (In fact, you will probably be able to recycle the slides you make many times). Powerpoint tips.

First class:
--teach them Pubmed
--use UTLink to find all enrolled students

The official way to look at rosters is through UT Link (<https://utlink2.uth.tmc.edu/utlink/Login.aspx>). You need an “A” number and password from the registrar to log in. You can also get the roster from Blackboard (Contol Panel/List Users/List All; each month is a different course), and you can make an announcement through Blackboard that is automatically emailed to the students. On the other hand, you need access to UT Link in order to enter grades, so if you don’t have that logon yet, you may as well get it soon.

Make sure you select "Medical Year 2010-2011" on UT LINK, Course Roster, Browse

Dear students,
Thank you for enrolling in the January edition of the Neuroimaging Elective.
The instructors will be me and Dr. Ellmore in the Department of Neurosurgery.
Our first meeting will be on Wednesday, January 5th at 2 p.m. in MSB B.645.
If you haven't already, please start thinking about a neuroimaging topic of interest to you.
Your focus should be on a new neuroimaging method that could help you diagnose or treat a disease of interest to you.
During the month, you will learn as much as possible about the method you choose by reading original peer-reviewed research papers from the scientific literature and then you will present what you have learned.
For instance, there have been recent advances in using fMRI to diagnose conscious awareness in persistent vegetative state patients
<http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/02/magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri-for-persistent-vegetative-state.html>
For other ideas, you can see papers on my web page at
<Publications.md>
Or search PubMed or Google Scholar. Dr. Ellmore and I will be available after the meeting on Wednesday for individual meetings to discuss your topic with you. See you on Wednesday!

p.s. Blackboard was upgraded over the holidays and there seem to be problems with the wiki function that is used for the elective. I will try to get the problems fixed by Wednesday.
