| This is the web page for information about the Graduate Neuroanatomy course (UT GSBS GS141181), a required course for neuroscience graduate students. The Graduate Neuroanatomy course provides a broad overview of the structure and function of the central nervous system. The general architecture of the nervous system and its functional systems are presented in a series of online exercises. The exercises allow the students to examine brain anatomy at a detailed view of the regional anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. Two wet laboratories (dissections) and structural MRIs of brain anatomy, as commonly presented in the scientific literature, will also be presented. The target audience for this course is first-year Ph.D. students in the Neuroscience Program. It is essential that Neuroscience students have a comprehensive knowledge of neuroanatomy to succeed in Systems Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroscience. Because these courses are offered in the Spring, Graduate Neuroanatomy must be taken in the Fall of the first year. It does not conflict with either the GSBS core course (M,W,F from 8:30-11am and Tues, Thursday 8:30-Noon) or the the Neuroscience Program core courses (M,W,F 12:00-2:30).  Course Objectives:   1. To introduce students to the main components of the central nervous system 2. To introduce students to the lobar, sulcal, and gyral architecture of the cerebral cortex 3. To introduce students to the functional subdivisions of the cortex and subcortical structures. 4. To study the anatomical organization of structures important for learning and memory, sensation, perception and motor control.   **Didactic Course Outline**   1. Exercise #1: External Anatomy of the Brain 2. Exercise #2: Internal Organization of the Brain 3. Exercise #3: Ventricles, Blood Vessels, and External Surface of the Brain Stem 4.

Exercise #11 Part B: The Hypothalamus   Students may access learning modules for each exercise here:   ```  https://oac22.hsc.uth.tmc.edu/courses/neuroanatomy/ ```   Login with your UT username and password. Click on "Begin Practice". Click on "Instructions" to read the instructions. You will only be using the "Practice" part of the website, NOT the "Credit" part.  **Practical Outline**  The course contains two wet laboratories and one MRI laboratory. The wet laboratories take place on the second floor of the UT medical school building; there is a complex of four rooms. 2.107 is the largest and is paired with 2.129, where our class will take place. The other two rooms are 2.105 and 2.131.   1.

[Click here for instructions on downloading the MRI datasets and viewer software.](MedNSLab.md "Beauchamp:MedNSLab")   **Evaluation and Grading** 30%: Weekly quizzes. Following each exercise, students will take a BlackBoard quiz on the material in that exercise.  How to take the quizzes on BlackBoard:   1. login to bb.uth.tmc.edu 2. find Graduate Neuroanatomy 2013 listed in your course list 3. click on "Content" in the green menu in the top left 4. click on "Quiz #1"   40%: Final exam. At the end of the course, students will take a BlackBoard final exam on the material in all exercises.  30%: Wet laboratories. Students will be evaluated on their performance in the brain dissection.
