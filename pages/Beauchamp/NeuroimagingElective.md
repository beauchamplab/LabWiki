| This is the web page for information about the neuroimaging elective for fourth-year medical students at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. In the 2010-2011 academic year, the course will be offered in November, December and January. **Each month, all students are required to attend the first meeting of the course.**   1. NOVEMBER: Monday, November 1st from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. in UT MSB B.645 (large classroom at the bottom of the stairs that go from the leather lounge to the basement).   Here is the link for the November course on Blackboard: <https://bb.uth.tmc.edu/webapps/lobj-wiki-bb_bb60/wiki/2010MBSCI4008-011/_1267694_1/Home>   1. DECEMBER: Wednesday, December 1st from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. in UT MSB B.645 (large classroom at the bottom of the stairs that go from the leather lounge to the basement). 2. JANUARY: Wednesday, January 5th from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. in UT MSB B.645 (large classroom at the bottom of the stairs that go from the leather lounge to the basement).   The course will be taught by Timothy Ellmore, Ph.D. (Department of Neurosurgery) and Michael Beauchamp, Ph.D. (Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy). The elective is designed to be primarily independent study, allowing for flexibility for students to schedule residency interviews. Students should select a topic of interest to them that will be helpful to them in their residency; for instance, dementia (Geriatrics); tumor (Neurosurgery); cerebral infarcts (Radiology); epilepsy (Neurology); dyslexia (Pediatrics); bipolar disorder (Psychiatry). Students will find papers from the primary scientific literature using PubMed or WebOfScience and study them to learn how a specific recent advance in neuroimaging will aid in the diagnosis or treatment of their topic of interest. For instance, how advances in MR angiography will aid in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral AVMs. (For students who would like to devote extra time to the elective, another option might be to volunteer in lab during that month and help with image analysis.) Each week, the student will schedule a time to meet with their instructor to discuss their progress. At the end of the month, each student will present a Powerpoint presentation on their findings.  In order to ensure a high-quality educational experience for all students we cannot exceed our maximum enrollment, currently set at 12 students per month.  Here is the official description of the course in the course catalog: <http://med.uth.tmc.edu/administration/student/catalog/10/BasicScience/BSCI4008.pdf>  misc teaching notes: [Beauchamp:ElectiveNotes](ElectiveNotes.html) |
