### Penn McGurk Battery

To make it easier to study the McGurk effect, the Beauchamp Lab has released the Penn McGurk Battery, consisting of 16 different McGurk stimuli.
Instructions for use:

#### 1) Download both PowerPoint files

Click each link below. This will take you to the DropBox website, where you should click the "Download" button on the top left.

```
 PennMcGurkBattery_A_Aud.PPTX
 PennMcGurkBattery_B_AV.PPTX
```

#### 2) Prepare to record participant responses

We recommend using a mobile phone's audio recording app ("Voice Memos" on iPhone) to record the entire session. This keeps a record of each stimulus and response. Alternately, the participant or experimenter can write or type each response on paper or electronically.

#### 3) Present the stimuli

Open PowerPoint and adjust the volume. Enter presentation mode. First, present

```
 PennMcGurkBattery_A_Aud.PPTX
```

This is the baseline measurement. Next, present

```
 PennMcGurkBattery_B_AV.PPTX
```

We recommend presenting *PennMcGurkBattery\_B\_AV.PPTX* multiple times (3 times, 5 times, or 10 times) for a more accurate measurement.

#### 4) McGurk Scoring

For the file *PennMcGurkBattery\_B\_AV.PPTX*: for each response different than "ba", one point is awarded. Divide the number of points by the total number of stimuli presented (16 stimuli \* the number of times through the entire file).

#### 5) Control Analysis

The *PennMcGurkBattery\_A\_Aud.PPTX* contains the stimuli in the same order as in the AV file, but in auditory-only (A) format. The A-only stimuli should always elicit a "ba" response. If a particular stimulus does not elicit a "ba" response for a participant, consider discarding the audiovisual version of this stimulus from the total McGurk score for that participant.
