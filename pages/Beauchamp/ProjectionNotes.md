Auditory insert headphones are used.
To protect hearing, muffler type hearing protectors are used over top.
These are 3M Optime 95 H6A/V Peltor that provide 33.5 dB attentuation at 1000 Hz (the approximate freq peak of the EPI sound).
Also available are Sperian Howard Leight Leightning LOF mufflers that have a thinner profile but only 27.2 dB at 1000 Hz.

The current projector is a Canon LV-7295 2600 Lumens XGA projector purchased for $369.95 from B&H Photo on 7/26/2012.
The projector was purchased using the ProjectorCentral website to find projectors with the correct zoom.
At UCLA, they use an Optoma PK201 and a Gefen DVI F5 500 to convert to fiber optic.
