| AFNI Short Course: October 4-8, 2010  [caption](../../attachments/ShortCourse2010/AFNIGroupSmall.jpg)  caption   [Click here for the group photo at full resolution: 8 MB.](../../attachments/ShortCourse2010/AFNIGroupLarge.jpg "AFNIGroupLarge.jpg")  The AFNI BootCamp is a week-long hands-on course on AFNI, a widely-used software package for fMRI data analysis. For more details on AFNI, see <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni> The course will be taught by the developers of AFNI, including Robert Cox, Ziad Saad, Rick Reynolds and Gang Chen, and will take place at the University of Texas Medical School, 6431 Fannin St, Houston, TX.

More Information  The course runs each day from 9 am until 6 pm. Participants must commit to attending the entire course.  **How do I register?** **Unfortunately, the course is currently full.** The following information is for the next offering of the course. Registration is only possible after payment of the registration fee. Only checks are accepted (no purchase orders or credit cards). Because it can take an unpredictable amount of time for academic institutions to generate checks, students are advised to pay their registration fee with a personal check (to guarantee a spot) and then request reimbursement from their academic institution. Otherwise, the course may fill before the check from the academic institution is received and registration is completed.  **Registation Fees** Registration fees for the short course are as follows:**$150 (graduate students) $200 (all others).** Early registration (which ended on July 1st) was $100 (graduate students), $150 (all others).  Please make checks payable to Rice University (no purchase orders or credit cards) and mail to   ```  Beauchamp Lab, UTHealth Neurobiology and Anatomy, 6431 Fannin Street Suite G.550G, Houston TX 77030. ```   Participants are not confirmed until the registration fee is received. [Click here to download a payment receipt (please fill in the correct name, date and amount yourself)](../../attachments/ShortCourse2010/AFNIWorkshopReceipt.doc "AFNIWorkshopReceipt.doc")  No CME credits can be provided. All registration fees are non-refundable but registration is freely transferable between participants. A registration form is **not** required, but if you would like a registration form (even though it is not required) you can download one here: [Click here to download the optional Registration Form](../../attachments/ShortCourse2010/Registrationform_AfNI.doc "Registrationform AfNI.doc")  **Sponsors**: The first ten participants from (defined as "primary affiliation with") each sponsoring department are no charge. The sponsoring departments are the UT Department of Psychiatry, UT Department of Neurosurgery and Rice Department of Psychology.  **What should I bring?** All participants should bring their own laptop computer with AFNI and SUMA already installed. If you do not have a laptop with AFNI installed, the recommended solution is to purchase an inexpensive Macintosh laptop (available for ~$1000); Linux laptops may also be used, but are more difficult to set up. AFNI will NOT run on Windows laptops. Because AFNI and SUMA are graphics intensive, they do not run well remotely (for instance, using a Windows X11 client connected to a server). For instructions on setting up a computer for the AFNI class, please see <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/HOWTO/howto/ht00_inst/html/class_setup.shtml> . If you have problems, please post a question to the AFNI message board at <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/list.php?f=1> **IMPORTANT:** Installing AFNI can be difficult and time-consuming. No time in the course is scheduled for software installation, so this must be completed BEFORE the beginning of the course.  **Where should I stay?** There are special course rates for participants at the Hotel ZaZa, located near the Texas Medical Center (5701 Main Street Houston, Texas 77005 Toll Free 888-880-3244 Local phone 713-526-1991). To make a reservation, visit <http://www.hotelzazahouston.com/> . In the lower right hand section of the hotel home page, there is a reservations section. Enter the dates and select "Group/Block Code" from the pull-down menu labeled "Promo Code"; enter "UTMS". The course rate is $118/nt.  Where is the course exactly?  The course will be in the largest classroom in the basement of the UT Medical School Building (MSB). The room number of the classroom is MSB B.645. The UT MSB is located at 6431 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77030. The Houston Metro has a transit stop directly in front of the building. The stop is called "Memorial Hermann Hospital/Houston Zoo". If you are driving, there is a large parking garage (labeled "UT Clinic Parking") located directly across Fannin Street from the Medical School building. If you are being dropped off or picked up, Ross Sterling Drive (off of Fannin) travels in a breezeway under the building. The only unlocked entrance to the UT MSB is on the side of the building opposite of Fannin Street (reach it by travelling through the breezeway; or enter the building through any door with someone who has a badge). As you enter the building, you will see a security desk, a coffee shop and a large stairway. Travel down the stairway and course classroom is immediately at the bottom of the stairs. Ask the guard at the security desk if you have problems. If you like, bring your favorite coffee mug or water bottle. We will provide cold and hot water tea. Other items can be purchased at the coffee shop.  Confirmed Participants  [Click here for more information on the participants](ShortCourse2010Participants.md)  The following is a list of all confirmed participants and their affiliations. There is limited seating in the classroom (UT MSB B.645; 66 seats total - 5 seats for instructors = 61 seats for students), and there is no additional space available for a remote or video overflow room. Because of the high demand for the course, it will likely be offered again in the future.     1. Liangsuo Ma (postdoctoral fellow, UT Psychiatry) 2.
