Jeff Zemla (graduate student, Rice Psychology) 18. Ashley Meyer (graduate student, Rice Psychology) I am a fifth year graduate student in the Cognitive Neuroscience program at Rice University, studying under Jessica Logan. We study long-term episodic memory and aging as well as and how to improve learning techniques (e.g., testing).

Cris Hamilton (research associate, Rice Psychology) research: language and memory, specifically interface of executive control and semantic memory. methods: fMRI, TMS, lesions studies 20. Jennifer Chen (graduate student, Rice Psychology) I'm a third year graduate student at Rice University, working with Dr. Denise Chen. Our research interests focus on the functions and features of human olfaction and how it interacts with other senses (e.g., vision and taste) by using fMRI, psychophysical measurements and physiological recordings. 21. Denise Chen (assistant professor, Rice Psychology) 22. Tao Wei (graduate student, Rice Psychology) 23. Siavash Pasalar (research associate, Beauchamp Lab) I use fMRI-guided TMS to study multisensory integration. 24. Audrey Nath (graduate student, Beauchamp Lab) I use fMRI to study multisensory integration of audiovisual speech. 25. Sarah Baum (graduate student, Beauchamp Lab) 26. Eswen Fava (graduate student, Beauchamp Lab) 27. Mary Newsome (assistant professor, Baylor College of Medicine PM&R) 28. Zahra Kadivar (postdoctoral fellow, Baylor College of Medicine PM&R) 29.

Randall Scheibel (associate professor, Baylor College of Medicine PM&R) 32. Jeffrey Katz (associate professor, Auburn University Psychology) 33. John Magnotti (graduate student, Auburn University Psychology) 34. Callie McGrath (graduate student, Emory University Neuroscience Program) 35. D. Reese McKay (graduate student, Research Imaging Institute, UTHSC-San Antonio) 36. Alexandre Franco (postdoctoral fellow, Emory University Department of Psychiatry) 37. Vladimir Ivkovic (graduate student, University of Houston) I work on sensory augmentation in Parkinson's disease as treatment for akinesia/bradkinesia. Interested in functional (fMRI) and structural (DTI) changes in the basal ganglia in response to extended duration vibrotactile sensory augmentation. 38. Anita Cservenka (graduate student, Oregon Health and Science University) I'm a grad student in the Department of Behavioral Neuroscience at OHSU. I work in the Developmental Brain Imaging Lab, led by Dr. Bonnie Nagel. I'm interested in adolescent brain development and brain function in youth at high risk for alcoholism. More info about me and the fellow grad student attending, Megan Herting, can be found here: <http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/psychiatry/research/developmental-brain-imaging-lab/research-staff/graduate-students.cfm> 39.

Jeremy Strain (graduate student, UT Dallas) 50. Megan Herting (Oregon Health Sciences University) I am a predoctoral student at OHSU in Portland, Oregon working with Dr. Bonnie Nagel. I use fMRI & DTI to study normal adolescent neurodevelopment. My dissertation work focuses on physical activity and brain development in adolescents. I fell in love with AFNI in 2007. 51. Neena Rao (graduate student, UT Dallas/Center for Brain Health) 52. Mingbo Cai (graduate student, BCM) I work with Dr. David Eagleman on time perception.

Caitlin Elmore (graduate student, UT Neurobiology and Anatomy)   I am a graduate student at UT-Houston working with Dr. Anthony Wright. My research involves using fMRI and behavioral studies to better understand visual working memory.   1. Ilana Bennett (postdoctoral fellow, UT Dallas/Center for Brain Health) 2. Yingying Tan (graduate student, Rice Psychology) I am a graduate student in Rice University working with Dr. Randi Martin. My research interests is language comprehension and its relationship to working memory capacity. 3. Nuray Yozbatiran (research instructor, UT/TIRR) 4. Jinchen Yang (postdoctoral fellow, UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain) 5. Mehereen Wadiwalla (University of Toronto) I am currently doing my PhD at University of Toronto which makes me a Canuck and no, I don't say eh after every sentence. On a day to day basis, I am usually found haunting the corridors of Hospital for Sick children and my PhD project is officially called "fMRI of response inhibition and error monitoring in adolescents with and without ADHD" but in reality its just an excuse for me to shove kids into the scanner because I am evil that way.  On a more serious note, I am an AFNI user and I see this course as a way to increase my understanding of the tool which will help me discover a previously unknown albeit extremely relevant information about brain regions in ADHD.
