## Learning more about Neuroimaging

To learn more about neuroimaging, consider the two course sequence taught by David Ress (BCM) and Michael S. Beauchamp (UT).

## Fundamentals of Human Neuroimaging

The first course in the sequence, taught in the Fall (Ress, course director), is a lecture course survey of neuroimaging methods and results. In 2014, the course was offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:50am to 12:05 pm. The course schedule may change in the future, please contact Dr. Ress for schedule information. This course is primarily listed as a BCM course (GS-NE-400) and is cross-listed at Rice as NEUR 430. Goals and learning objectives:

1. Develop familiarity with basic neuroanatomy and electrophysiology.
2. Understand the physical basis of magnetic resonance imaging of tissue structure, including the nuclear magnetic resonance, contrast mechanisms, image acquisition, signal processing, and scanner hardware.
3. Understand the physiology of neurovascular coupling, and explore its effects on both optical signals and MRI.
4. Understand basic concepts, hardware, and analysis of positron emission tomography.
5. Become familiar with neuroscience imaging experiment design, analysis, and results, particularly as they are applied human vision science.

Neuroscience elective. 3 Credits for 2 terms (Terms 1 and 2). T/Th. Prerequisites: Introductory Calculus and Physics at the freshman level. Course director: David Ress, Ph.D.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory

The second course in the sequence, taught in the Spring (Beauchamp, course director) with limited enrollment is a laboratory course that focusses on MRI. Students will collect and analyze MRI data. The lab course is designed for graduate students, fellows, and others actively collecting MRI data for a research project. In 2014, the course was offered on Wednesday from 9am to 11:30am. The course will next be offered in Spring 2016.

### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory Course Details

Students will need to take an MRI safety course. Krista Runge will offer one on Sept 18 at 1 p.m., or will offer one specially for students in the class if that time is not convenient. The web page for students in this course to submit assignments and receive information about the course is <https://owlspace-ccm.rice.edu/portal> For Fall 2014 - Spring 2015, this course will be offered on Wednesday mornings from 9 am to 11:30 am in UT MSB B.625 The first class will be Wednesday September 3 and the last class will be Wednesday December 10th. There will be no class on November 19th (Society for Neuroscience annual meeting) or November 26th (Thanksgiving Holiday). In general, the course follows the schedule of the UT GSBS.

This course is intended for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty who are interested in using fMRI for their research. A small number of undergraduates may also enroll in the course solely at the discretion of the instructor (only undergraduates who are currently working in a laboratory that uses functional MRI study will be considered). The course is primarily offered through the University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences GSBS 140053 (<http://www.uthouston.edu/gsbs/current-students/academics/course-listing/courses/neuroscience/gs140053-introduction-to-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-.htm>). The course is also cross-listed at Rice University in the Psychology and Bioengineering departments (as Psych 579 and BioE 571) and in the Baylor College of Medicine Graduate School of Biological Sciences (as GS-NE-439) (<http://neuro.bcm.edu/?sct=neuro_think&gp=cdescript>). If you are a student at UT, Rice or Baylor contact your registrar for enrollment information. If you are a student at University of Houston, it is probably easiest to enroll in the course via cross-registration through Rice University. (UT requires vaccination records for cross-registration which is annoying). However, if you would like to enroll through UT, please visit this web page for information about enrolling in the course: <http://registrar.uth.tmc.edu/Registration/ConcurEnrollment.html>

The textbook for this course is "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging", **2nd edition**, by Huettel, Song and McCarthy. The text may be ordered from Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-Second/dp/0878932860> or it is available at the UT bookstore at a 10% discount.

After Fall 2014, the course will undergo substantial renovation. It will be renamed "Fundamentals of Human Neuroimaging" and split into two parts that will be offered in the Fall and Spring of every year. Dr. David Ress will teach the first part, primarily a lecture course on basic principles. Dr. Beauchamp will teach the second part, primarily a lab course on applied fMRI techniques.

1. Spring 2015: no fMRI course
2. Fall 2015: Ress teaches part I (more theoretical)
3. Spring 2016: Beauchamp teaches part II (more practical)
4. Repeat for each following Fall/Spring

## GS14 1181: Graduate Neuroanatomy

Fall/annually/1-credit hour course. The Graduate Neuroanatomy course will provide a broad overview of the structure and function of the central nervous system. The general architecture of the nervous system and its functional systems are presented in a series of online exercises. The exercises allow the students to examine brain anatomy at a detailed view of the regional anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. MRIs of brain anatomy, as commonly presented in the scientific literature, will be presented using a computerized learning system.
