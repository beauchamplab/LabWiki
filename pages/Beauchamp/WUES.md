Notes on Volunteers for WUES Science Night
April 14th, 2011

1. To make it easier for the kids to identify you, please bring along your white coats to wear.
2. The science night will be at West University Elementary School (3756 University Blvd, Houston TX, 77005) about 2 miles from the med center. There is plenty of parking all around the school.

I don't know if you still need any more volunteers, but I'd be glad to help out. I can do any of the times, so you can place me where there is a lack (5-6 will be my default if you have no preference).
