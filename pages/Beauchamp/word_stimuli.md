# How to make noisy word stimuli (as of Oct2020)

## Overview

This is the same method for making noisy word stimuli that was used in Rennings et al paper.

This method ONLY decreased the SNR in word videos, DID NOT change the SNR in the normalized pink noise video.

## Other method for making AnV and An stimuli (noisy audiovisual and auditory-only videos)

This method decreased the SNR in word videos AND increased the SNR in the normalized pink noise video.

The videos made by this method was saved as XXX\_Oldmethod in our shared drive (e.g., wordvariability\_-4dB\_AnAcVAnVAcV\_Oldmethod), and were used for the mTurk study 2020.

These videos were used as stimuli for subjects RQ, RR, RS, RT, RU, and RV.
