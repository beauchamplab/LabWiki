| CAMRI Policies and Procedures  A copy of CAMRI's Safety and Operations Policies and Procedures Manual can be found \*[Click here](../../attachments/CAMRI_PricingAndPolicies/Policies_and_Procedures1.pdf "Policies and Procedures1.pdf")  CAMRI MRI Scanner Pricing Structure  **Please be aware that Fiscal year 2024 pricing changes will take effect on July 1st and consists of the following changes:**   - Scan rate: $565/hr - $250 for level 1 training - $500 for level 2 training - 15% of scan session for MRI Tech assistance      1. Before data collection can begin, the PI must attend all necessary training and submit required documentation, including an IRB-approved protocol and consent form. [Click here for an IRB proposal template.](CPHS.md "CAMRI:CPHS") 2. Scanner time and MR technologist assistance is reserved by emailing CAMRI staff (see below, Booking a Scan). The minimum duration of a scan session is one hour. 3. Billing is automatic, based on the amount of scanner time reserved in iLab. See below for the cancellation policy. All cancellation requests should be sent to camri-staff@listserv.bcm.edu 4. Credit cards are accepted but prices will be 4% higher than those listed above (equal to the fee charged by our credit card processing service). If a group is using a credit card they must inform Lacey **BEFORE** they start scanning. 5. Non-BCM users should pay by PO or check. Credit cards for payment should only be used as a last resort and will accrue the 4% fee above.     Discount Pricing  Starting September 1st 2023: We do offer discount pricing for frequent users. Below are the discounted pricing and usage hours per lab.   ```                0-20 hours:  - $550/hr                21-40 hours: - $500/hr                41-60 hours: - $450/hr                61-80 hours: - $425/hr                81< hours:   - $385/hr ```   (Please note that technologist time is not discounted)  FY 25 Discount Pricing: Starting July 1st 2024. Below are the discounted pricing and usage hours per lab for FY 25.   ```                0-20 hours:  - $565/hr                21-40 hours: - $515/hr                41-60 hours: - $465/hr                61-80 hours: - $440/hr                81< hours:   - $400/hr ```   Estimated Future Pricing  *Please Note:* To account for inflation, scanning fees will be adjusted annually. Therefore, if you are budgeting for grants, we recommend you budget the following:   ```                FY24 (July 1 2023) - $550                FY25 (July 1 2024) - $565                FY26 (July 1 2025) - $580                FY27 (July 1 2026) - $621                FY28 (July 1 2027) - $661                FY29 (July 1 2028) - $683 ```   The above represents inflation-adjusted increase annually with 5 years delay. Only the pricing for FY24 is definite. All future years are subject to change and are only an estimate. We are posting these to give users a guideline at the start of their study so that necessary price increases are not disruptive.  Data Archive Retrieval Fee  If you forgot to back up your data from BOX or the scanner we can retrieve it from archives for $30/session. Please be aware that all sessions are deleted from box and the scanner console every 30 days. Please back up your data after each session.    Booking a Session   1. To schedule time on the scanner, you must use the iLab website <https://bcm.corefacilities.org/service_center/show_external/3684>. Security clearance forms for all non-BCM visitors and lab members will need to be sent to: camri-staff@listserv.bcm.edu at time of reservation.  1. Each person that will be present at the scan (researchers and participants) will need to have clearance to enter the building.   **All requests should be sent in a timely manner to ensure security access**  To request security access for a visitor please submit the following form to CAMRI:   - [Click here for Security Clearance Form.](../../attachments/CAMRI_PricingAndPolicies/Visitor_Form_COVID.pdf "Visitor Form COVID.pdf") (This information should be copied and pasted into the email for each visitor)   To have CAMRI staff member reserve the ILAB calendar for you please submit the following form to CAMRI:   - [Click here for Scanner scheduling Form.](../../attachments/CAMRI_PricingAndPolicies/Scanner_scheduling_form.pdf "Scanner scheduling form.pdf")   *Please Note:* CAMRI does not control BCM security. We're more than happy to answer questions about how to get access for researchers and participants, but it's the responsibility of the user to know who needs to be there and plan accordingly to get appropriate access.  Cancelling a Session  Updated policy: To facilitate scheduling, we have updated the cancellation policy. Cancellations will be free up until 24 hours before the scheduled scan start time.  Cancellations within 24 hours will be fully charged. We will monitor cancellations to ensure investigators are not overbooking and canceling frequently.  After a reservation is made, users have 24 hours until the start of the scan to modify or cancel it without charge. If reserved time is not used for any reason (including subject no-show, subject failure to meet screening criteria, experimental difficulties, or any other reason) users will be charged the full rate for the unused time, unless the user reports the cancellation at least 24 hours prior to the start of the reserved time (allowing other users a chance to use the time) in which case the user will be charged at half the normal rate.  **Email all cancellation requests to camri-staff@listserv.bcm.edu**  Running a Session   1. All personnel attending a scan should be Level 1 or 2 trained unless they are the participant. Every scan needs at least one Level 2 trained operator to be present for the entire session. If your study does not have a Level 2 trained member of staff, you can coordinate with Lacey to run your scans for you. 2. After-hours and weekend scanning sessions can be booked by Level 2 operators only. 3. After each session, please fill out the Session Information Form (located in the black tray at the console). Staple the MRI screening form for your participant to your session info form, and place it in the purple folder. 4. Users must ensure they book enough time to disinfect and clean up the room after their session. The disinfection checklist is located on the bottom half of the session information form. This must be completed each session! |
