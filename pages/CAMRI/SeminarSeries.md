| **On hold for summer and will resume in the Fall**  **Tentatively held on every 2nd and 4th Thursday each month from 11 am - noon (Central Standard Time) via ZOOM conference with some additional weekdays depending on speaker availability. Please refer to email updates for announcements and reminders.**  The series will run in two parallel tracks:  **(1) Neuroimaging track (Every 4th Thursday).**  This track will features speakers external to BCM presenting their neuroimaging work. The Seminar Series features leaders in the field of human neuroscience discussing their latest research.  Suggestions for speakers are welcome. Please send suggestions to Junqian (Gordon) Xu (junqian.xu@bcm.edu).  **(2) Journal-club/Lab-mixer track (Every 2nd Thursday).**  This track will feature informal presentations from CAMRI faculty and trainees on their own projects or on literature of interest. These will be shorter presentations to leave ample time for discussion.The purpose of the journal club is to discuss high-impact, insightful articles from all areas of human neuroscience, especially functional and anatomical MRI. The format is an interactive, open forum with a primary presenter and the full participation of the audience. This journal club will provide a learning environment for the critical analysis of journal articles, presentation skills, and experimental design.  If you or a lab member would like to present, please send nominations (name, lab, title of the talk and preferred presentation date) to Junqian (Gordon) Xu (junqian.xu@bcm.edu).    If you or someone you know would like to be notified about upcoming seminars, please contact camri-staff@listserv.bcm.edu.  **Academic Year 2021-2022**   Seminars during this year will be completely virtual.
