CAMRI provides technology and services for advanced imaging studies of the function, physiology and anatomy of humans and large animals, with a special emphasis on blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) of the human brain.  The center houses two Siemens Prisma Fit scanners (3 tesla field strength). A full complement of product pulse sequences are available for:   1. High-resolution structural imaging 2. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 3. fMRI 4. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) 5. Single and multi-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).   Research sequences are available for specialized imaging applications.  For functional studies, equipment is available for:   1. stimulation of the auditory, visual, somatosensory and gustatory modalities 2. Infrared eye tracking of subject eye position 3. Manual and vocal response recording.     Visiting CAMRI  CAMRI is located on the first floor of the Smith Research Wing of Baylor College of Medicine.  Visitors can enter Baylor at one of two entrances:   1. Baylor Main Entrance: Located at One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX. This entrance is most convenient for those walking, being dropped off or taking public transit. 2. TMC Garage 6: Most convenient for those driving.
