The release burst includes all audio from the beginning of the release burst up until the first positive zero crossing of the first pitch pulse.

To find the release burst duration using PRAAT:

---

1. Open the sound file in PRAAT. With the file selected in the main menu, click on "View and Edit".

2. Identify the location at which sound begins, shown by the first place where the amplitude is greater than 0.

3. Click on this location. Drag the cursor to the zero crossing of the first regular waveform.

4. The time should appear as a black number directly above the selection. This is the release burst duration.
