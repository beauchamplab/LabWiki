Hello and welcome to the Karas Lab! We are a neurosurgery lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. We focus on the analysis of intracranial electroencephalogram recordings (iEEG). Our present projects focus on auditory and visual speech processing and multisensory integration, in addition to localization of the epileptogenic zone for patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Our main objective is to advance the understanding of how the brain processes information, and how this goes awry in disease. To further these goals, we make cutting-edge analysis tools and develop novel methods that are freely available to clinicians and researchers ensuring straightforward validation and reproducibility.
