## Alphabetical List of iEEG Software Tools

asa <https://www.ant-neuro.com/products/asa>
asa is a highly flexible EEG/ERP and MEG analysis software package with a variety of source reconstruction, signal analysis and MRI processing tools.

BESA <https://www.besa.de/>
BESA is the most widely used software for source analysis and dipole localization in EEG and MEG research.

Brainstorm <https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/>
Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings: MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and animal invasive neurophysiology.

Brain Vision Analyzer <https://www.brainproducts.com/promo_analyzer2.php>
Analysis software for EEG/ERP research.

Chronux <http://chronux.org/>
Software package for the analysis of neural data that may be employed in the analysis of both point process and continuous data, ranging from preprocessing, exploratory and confirmatory analysis.

CURRY <https://compumedicsneuroscan.com/curry-epilepsy-evaluation>
CURRY is an ideal software platform for combining and processing the various datasets that are obtained from a patient during an Epilepsy evaluation. CURRY combines multiple data sets (EEG, ECoG, MEG, MRI, fMRI, CT, DTI, and PET) to ensure the maximum information from the patients complete data set is utilized in making critical decisions.

Software to measure, describe and visualize human brain dynamics.

FieldTrip <http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/>
A software toolbox for MEG, EEG, iEEG and NIRS analysis.

FreeSurfer <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>
A software suite for processing and analyzing (human) brain MRI images.

iELVIS <http://ielvis.pbworks.com/w/page/116347253/FrontPage>
iELVIS (Intracranial ELectrode VISualization) is a software toolbox for intracranial electrode localization/visualization, mapping electrodes to various anatomical and functional atlases, and overlaying electrode data over functional neuroimaging data.

img\_pipe <https://github.com/ChangLabUcsf/img_pipe>
An imaging pipeline for running a patient's brain surface reconstruction and electrode localization/labeling.

MNE-Python <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>
Software for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more.

Persyst <https://www.persyst.com/>
