To begin, launch the RAVE Preprocessing Module from RStudio with the following command:

```
>rave::rave_preprocess()
```

The Preprocessing Module will launch in a browser window or tab, if the browser is already opened. The initial page should be the Overview page. Select the “Step 1. Notch Filter” panel from the black menu at the far left. This page has three panels: “Notch Filter,” “Inspection,” and “Notch – inspect signals.” Each of these panels has a minimize icon at the top right and a help icon beside it. Click the “help” icon at any time to open in a new browser tab the RAVE wiki page associated with this panel.
